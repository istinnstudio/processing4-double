This is a quick and experimental modification of the Processing core to support double-precision coordinates across fundamental classes like PShape, PVector, and others.
Note: This change may introduce issues with color/styling as many float values have been converted to double including some objects that should not. Initial testing in a pure Java IDE using PApplet has shown promising results using casting, suggesting compatibility with existing code with minimal adjustments.
The original Processing framework supports only float precision for coordinates, which can lead to rounding errors in high-precision calculations. This modification aims to address those limitations.
Warning: Use with caution. This is based on Processing version 4.3.2 from the repository at https://github.com/processing/processing4.
